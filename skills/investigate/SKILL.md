# Deep Investigation Skill

**Trigger**: Use `/investigate {incident report}` when you need a thorough investigation of an incident, bug, or unexpected behavior.

**Input**: An incident report (typically generated by the `/incident` skill) describing what happened.

**Examples**:
- `/investigate Extraction hung at 12% - no error in logs, last event was url_refresh_triggered at 07:38 UTC`
- `/investigate Rate limiting errors despite batch processing - 429 responses every 2 seconds starting 14:00 UTC`
- `/investigate Health check showing red but API responding - monitor page shows Backend=red since 09:15 UTC`

---

## Instructions

THINK MAX HARD about this incident.

And do this:

1. **Research online** for relevant documentation and known issues (search as of {current_month_year})
2. **Consult relevant API/library documentation** based on what the incident involves (search as of {current_month_year})
3. **Deeply investigate** the incident provided after `/investigate`
4. **Review past RCAs and Investigations** in `docs/RCAs/` and `docs/investigations/` to avoid repeating errors and recognize patterns
5. **Write detailed Investigation Report** to `docs/investigations/{YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM}_{issue_name}.md`
6. **THEN STOP** and await further instructions

## Investigation Process

### Step 1: External Research

**Search online** (use current date context: {current_month_year}):
- Search for known issues, bugs, or limitations related to the problem
- Search for relevant API documentation updates
- Look for community discussions or Stack Overflow answers

**Consult Relevant Documentation**:

First, identify what technology/API/library the incident involves. Then search for documentation specific to that technology.

**EXAMPLES** (use these as a pattern, NOT as default searches):
- If the incident involves **Iterable**: Search "Iterable API {relevant_topic} {current_month_year}"
- If the incident involves **Intercom**: Search "Intercom API {relevant_topic} {current_month_year}"
- If the incident involves **GCS/Google Cloud Storage**: Search "Google Cloud Storage {relevant_topic} {current_month_year}"
- If the incident involves **httpx/requests**: Search "Python httpx {relevant_topic} {current_month_year}"
- If the incident involves **FastAPI**: Search "FastAPI {relevant_topic} {current_month_year}"
- If the incident involves **PostgreSQL**: Search "PostgreSQL {relevant_topic} {current_month_year}"

**IMPORTANT**: Only search documentation relevant to the actual incident. Do NOT default to searching Iterable or Intercom docs unless the incident specifically involves those APIs.

From the documentation, extract:
- Rate limits, timeouts, expected behavior
- Recent API changes or deprecations
- Known limitations or gotchas

### Step 2: Gather Internal Evidence

- Search logs for relevant events
- Read related source code files
- Check recent changes that might be related
- Look for patterns in timing, data, or behavior

### Step 3: Build Timeline

Construct a precise timeline of events:
- When did the incident first appear?
- What happened immediately before?
- What was the system state?

### Step 4: Identify Root Cause

- Distinguish between symptoms and causes
- Identify primary, secondary, and contributing factors
- Trace the code path that led to the incident
- Compare our implementation against official API documentation

### Step 5: Analyze Impact

- What was affected?
- How much data/time was lost?
- What is the blast radius?

### Step 6: Review Past RCAs and Investigations (MANDATORY)

**Before recommending any fixes**, you MUST:

1. **Read all files in `docs/RCAs/`** - Look for:
   - Similar issues that were previously resolved
   - Fixes that were implemented and their effectiveness
   - Patterns that keep recurring

2. **Read all files in `docs/research/`** - Look for:
   - Previous research on related technologies or APIs
   - Best practices and anti-patterns already documented
   - Implementation guidance that applies to this incident

3. **Read all files in `docs/plans/`** - Look for:
   - Implementation plans that addressed similar issues
   - Approaches that were planned but may not have been fully implemented
   - Step-by-step fixes that could be reused or adapted

4. **Read all files in `docs/investigations/`** - Look for:
   - Related incidents
   - Root causes that might apply here
   - Recommended fixes that were or weren't implemented

3. **Document patterns found**:
   - Has this exact issue occurred before?
   - Has a similar issue occurred before?
   - Did a previous fix inadvertently cause this issue?
   - Is this a regression of a previously fixed bug?

**This step ensures we**:
- Don't repeat mistakes
- Learn from past incidents
- Recognize recurring patterns
- Build on previous solutions rather than reinventing them
- Leverage existing research on related technologies
